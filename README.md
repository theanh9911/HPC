# HPC Final Project

This project implements a machine learning model using TensorFlow. The project is set up with a Python virtual environment for dependency management.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- pip (Python package installer)
- PowerShell (for Windows environment)

## Setup Instructions

1. Create and activate the virtual environment:
```powershell
# Create virtual environment
py -3.11 -m venv venv_tf_prj

# Activate virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
.\venv_tf_prj\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project consists of several main components:
- `data_processing`: Scripts for data preprocessing and preparation
- `train_model`: Scripts for model training and evaluation

## Usage

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, you can run the following commands:

1. Process the data:
```powershell
python data_processing.py
```

2. Train the model:
```powershell
python train_model.py
```

## Environment

- Operating System: Windows 10
- Python Version: 3.11
- Package Management: pip
- Virtual Environment: venv
